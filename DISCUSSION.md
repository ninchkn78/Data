### Issues in Current Code

 * What pieces of code help versus obscure your understanding?

Cameron said that my methods had informative names and I utilized the API well which meant it 
was easy to understand what was going on in the code the entire time.

 * What names in the code are helpful and what makes other names less useful?
 
 The methods were named well from above. I changed a few of my local variables to not be abbreviated
 to make sure that their purpose was clear.

 * What additional methods might be helpful to make the code more readable or usable?
 
 We couldn't think of anything.

 * What assumptions does this code have?

When there are ties in the count of names, my methods just return the first one alphabetically.

 * What comments might be helpful within the code?

 * WhatÂ Code SmellsÂ did you find?

I had some nested if statements that I refactored to be a single one with && instead.


### Refactoring Plan

Since I had already spent a lot of time refactoring my code, Cameron couldn't really come up with 
anything for me to change. All my methods are fewer than 10 lines right now, and each one performs
simple and useful tasks. There is one place where I have about 5 lines of code that are duplicated,
but the TA told me to not worry about it since refactoring would require using lambda methods and 
at this point in the course would not necessarily make it look cleaner.
